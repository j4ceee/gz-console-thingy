    {" Something No One Else Dreamed About", "collectable_newspaper_08", "8th issue.\nFIGHT BACK BY TAKING ON ASSIGNMENTS\n\nPreviously I’ve mentioned Aster’s initiative to help survivors all over Östertörn to organize in the war against the machines. Aster has since then been working night and day to make this a reality, and now her efforts are paying off! As of today, anyone can gain access to specific military communication computers (called FMTel stations) and see information that Aster is sending out! By hacking into this system Aster is able to send out lists describing growing threats we observe, so that survivors can focus their energy on tackling high priority tasks.\n\n“I wanted to help organize things,” Aster says and sips on what must be her fifth glass of cola since I entered her office. “Sometimes people just don’t know what to do, and they can feel unmotivated to go on. But knowing that they are part of something bigger can help. Knowing that we are here in Östervik, that they are contributing, like you always tell us to do Marja – that truly helps people. So I just wanted to be a part of that.”\n\nI feel truly inspired standing in Aster’s cramped office. Here’s a person who’s seen an area where their expertise can help. Aster alone has come up with something no one else dreamed about. If you feel discouraged and don’t know how to help, just look at Aster and think about your personal strengths and how to use them. As I leave her office, Aster has turned back to the FMTel station, laughing as she rapidly types on the machine. I think I hear her mutter something about a bike before I leave.

This will be a place to share important information to keep us all better informed about what’s actually going on around us. Some of you have already told me this is a waste of time and resources, but I’m going to ask you to give this a chance and see what happens. Right now I’m seeing people without any farming knowledge accidentally kill their plants, while others have the knowledge but not enough manpower. Many are afraid because they heard rumours that machines have been sighted nearby, while the scout teams know that it was just a guy who got scared by a rustling bush - it does not need to be this way!\n\nMy hope is that this newsletter will make us more connected. Which will in turn make us stronger. So please bear with me! And if you have anything to share: don’t hesitate to come see me at my office in Varuhuset in Old Östervik, and help make this newsletter truly important.\n\nABOUT ME\nHello everyone, I’m Marja - the rugged-looking mum you can find trying to make a home at the Post Office in old Östervik. I know we all look pretty rugged by now, but sometimes I don't even recognize myself in the mirror, and that’s a bit scary.\n\nI arrived with my family from up north some days ago (my husband Fredrik and our 6-year old Nikoli say hi as well). We had heard rumours about survivors in Östervik, but I hadn’t dared to hope there would be this many. I actually started crying when I saw the intact barricades - that’s a VERY NICE sight. I hope this newsletter can become a part of what you all have built here, and to those whom I’ve already talked to about this: I’ll try my best to not let you down!

We have heard before of Soviet soldiers in the areas north of Boo Town, and I know that this has made people both worried and hopeful. Are they here to invade, or will they help? Right now we’re trying to prepare for either possibility, which is quite stressful.\n\nThis week there arrived a group of people who were actually at Boo Town as the Soviets arrived. From what they tell me the Soviets suddenly marched down from the north and quickly fortified the northern parts of Boo with some kind of ready-made fortification walls. The Östertörn survivors already had defenses at the bridge in case of a machine attack, so they found themselves in some sort of involuntary stalemate. They received no signs of either an attack or attempts at communication though. Instead they report sightings of the Soviets setting up what looked like observation posts. After two days, the machines came in heavy on the whole town (possibly as a reaction to the Soviet presence, but no one really knows for sure) and as far as they know the Soviets retreated back further north.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, we know what happened in Boo Town. The good news is that apparently we’re not at war with Soviet. Yet, anyway. Personally I think they are here to get a grasp on what’s going on with the killer machines. Even though I admit they should have talked to us if it’s information they want. Anyway, we clearly need to keep an eye on the northern areas, so that we know what’s going on.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTES\nI am sad to say that this will be the last newsletter issue for a while. So many of you have expressed your support and gratitude for my work over these weeks that I’m actually crying a bit as I write this. We have come a long way together. But as I’m taking a more active role as the President of the Resistance Community Meetings I will need to focus my time there for a bit. The frequent requests that I meet with all our different groups in person to help organize and evaluate the current structure will also be something that requires a lot of my time, but I’m more than happy to do it! We’re moving forward, I can feel it!\n\nKnow that you will all always be in my heart. Whether as your Editor or as your President, I will always strive to give you all the best possible future. And I’ll still be at the Post Office if you ever want to discuss something. I will listen. And remember: If you fight for something you believe in, anything is possible! \nYours, Marja", 961.089661f, 1050.257202f, -109.221214f},

Philip’s voice is broken and he speaks sparingly, as if every word is a fight. He warns me not to get too close since his protective equipment didn’t fully keep him safe from the radiation. But he wants us to know what’s there.\n   “They didn’t drop it just anywhere,” he coughs. “Bunker. There’s a bunker there. A hidden one. Not part of the evacuation program. Secret. Except that someone must have known. Someone with a bomb knew and didn’t like it.”\n   I feel stunned. What does a secret bunker mean? I ask if Philip got inside but all he could enter were the transportation corridors. The doors leading further in were all locked. So is whoever dropped the bomb satisfied now, or should we anticipate more to come?\n   “We don’t know how many secrets they hid here,” Philip says. “This archipelago idyll was more important than we all knew. And more twisted.”\n   But even so, it has now been over a month since the bomb dropped, and we have seen no further activity in the area. Neither machines nor any foreign soldiers seem interested.\n   “But they know more than we,” Philip coughs and stares with vacant eyes at the clouds. “The ones with the bombs know more about our dirty little secrets than we do.” His voice is little more than a rasp now. I hand him a glass of water before he silently nods that there is nothing more to say.\n\nBUYING APPLES\n“The Growing Tree” wants to inform everyone that they are interested in buying apples and have both food and ammunition to trade.

    {"That Tremendous Explosion", "collectable_newspaper_03", "3rd issue.\nDOES ANYONE HAVE INFO ABOUT THE BOMB? \n\nMany of you are asking about the bomb. I understand that. We are all shaken by it. If you, or someone you know, knows anything about it please come see me. People need more information about this. I think we all felt the earthquake and heard that tremendous explosion. At first I thought it was some new horrendous machine, and if it wasn’t for my family, I honestly think I would have given up then and there. Is it strange to say that I felt relief when I saw the cloud form in the sky? A nuclear bomb is the most horrible thing we knew of from before, and yet it was better than another one of these monster machines hunting us. That says something about the new world we’re living in. Some of you think the bomb came from the machines, but I don’t think that (or is it just that I can’t think that because it would break me? Sometimes I don’t know anymore). I think it must be some other force trying to help us against the machines, and I will cling to that hope until proven wrong.\n\nPRACTICE YOUR SHOOTING SKILLS\nUnsure how to handle a gun? Let Ousmane help you! He’s holding shooting practice each Tuesday and Thursday up by the school as long as people show up. He previously worked as an instructor in the military, so you will be in good hands. Also, if you’re in a bad mood his never ending smile and infectious laugh might be what’s needed to cheer you up.

Riikka even came by my office to tell me they have gotten all the help they need at the farm for now. In just a week! I think that’s amazing!

    {"Things Might Turn Ugly", "collectable_newspaper_09", "9th issue.\nLEAVING THE IRON CHURCH\n\nMost of the residents of Östervik have come to know about the group calling themselves “The Iron Church” by now. If you don’t know what I speak of, it's the often quite muscular people who always move in groups and seem to think that all food belongs to them. They’ve even set up some kind of “recruitment corner” here in Old Östervik - which I advise you all to stay far away from!!\n\nLisa has lived with the Iron Church for over 2 months before she decided to leave them. “I read your article about Aster and it’s so nice how you all have your different ways to contribute here. It made me think about how I can help. And so here I am,” Lisa says. Her eyes briefly meet mine before they return to scanning the windows behind me. There have been several confrontations between the Iron Church and the Östervik Resistance lately, and Lisa is worried that things might turn ugly. “I’ve read about the Östervik Resistance since the first newsletter, you know. I would never forgive myself if I just sat back and let the Iron Church destroy what you’ve built up.”\n\nThe group existed already before the Cataclysm. “They were prepared for something like this,” Lisa says. “The members had stocked up on food and they were all training vigorously to be as ready as possible for the day when foreign countries would invade. That’s why I joined them to begin with. I mean, I just wanted to survive the next day and they seemed to know what they were doing. My mind was all desperate, ever since I ran from the machines that first day I’ve not been able to actually think, my mind has just been shut off while my body has been running. But boy, was I wrong to join them. Do you know that new members are put on a field with nothing but a baseball bat, and are only allowed to return once they’ve killed a machine? I’ve seen three young recruits die this way and I’m sure that’s not even all! It’s forbidden to express any kind of weakness, like showing doubt that you would be fit enough to take on tons of machines.”\n\nLisa sighs and nervously scratches a scar on her left arm. “All these recent fights over loot… The Iron Church members are getting more and more annoyed with you guys, you know. I think some of them are planning some kind of “retribution”. But I read that you have your own food production going on, right? You don’t need to risk a fight over some canned beans, so maybe we can just leave the looting to them and just not involve ourselves?” Lisa looks at me with such pleading eyes that I have to stop myself from making any promises then and there.\n\nThe information that Lisa has so courageously shared with us is very much something that we as a community need to reach a decision about, and fast. I’m lifting this to be the main topic for the Resistance Community Meeting this Friday. Please join if you’re able.\n\nEditor’s note: Lisa is not the person’s real name.", 842.102417f, 1039.890869f, 292.499298f},

And this glorious “before” is, as far as I can tell, people living side by side without coordinating anything; patrols covering the same areas without knowing about it, fresh food going to waste because one group of people has too much while others go hungry just two streets away - these are things that were happening before and they PUT US ALL AT RISK. Sure, I know that a lot of people don’t like schedules, but is that inconvenience really worth the machines killing your friends?\n\nAnd you know what? All this RELUCTANCE to search for better ways to survive just makes me want to do MORE. You think that a schedule for patrols and food scavenging is a big thing? This is just the start! It’s time that we look at the bigger picture. I mean, what’s our main goal here? What’s our vision? Our dreams and hopes?\n\nIf I had a shotgun for each time someone told me to “not be so optimistic” I could make an army out of the whole world by now. But how do we know where to go if no one dares to dream any more? Do you honestly think we would die if we were a bit optimistic now and again? I know it’s hard, but you actually CAN be optimistic even if you’ve lost a close one. Dangnabbit, that’s the exact time you NEED to be a bit optimistic! Right now we are only set on surviving. Growing food and having organised patrols is all well and good, but is this really the best we can do? Is following a schedule really the end of our limits? No! Of course not! But we do need something to set our eyes on. A long term plan to believe in - and a plan that does not involve all of us throwing ourselves at the machines in some foolhardy attack, please. So when you’re done complaining and actually want to discuss alternative solutions: just come by my office. Let's figure this out together, okay? \nYours, Marja \n\nMISSING PERSON\nBörje Persson has been missing for a week. Last known to have gone to trade apples with “The Growing Tree”.

And now it has happened! This week Östervik’s first Resistance Community Meeting was held!\n\nWe had 9 people attending, which is amazing - 9 people who want to take responsibility and think about ways we can evolve. We had coffee and freshly baked cinnamon buns, and I’ll make sure we find you something nice for the next meeting as well! The Community Meetings are open for anyone, so don’t hesitate to come and check them out!\n\nThis time we discussed the need to better organize our patrols. Up until now the military group has been responsible for all patrols, but they are too few and are exhausting themselves, so we need more people to learn how to do this. Commander Ström will put together a mentor arrangement for you to join, and I assured her that many of you out there will show up to help with this, so don’t fail me now! We depend on you!\n\nOther than patrol duty we will look into organized scavenging and farming, and Aster talked about hacking into the military communication systems so that we can reach survivors all over Östertörn - she will look into that.\n\nFor questions regarding the Community Meetings, come see me or Anders.

Apparently the gnomes have merged with these machines. This all seems a bit far fetched if you ask me, but there are people here who SWEAR that they have seen them. I guess that until we know more, the wisest cause of action might be to stay away from any gnomes you come across? Just in case they turn out to be some kind of hybrid killing machine?

The only problem as I see it is that people don’t know that they are needed. \n\n“I’m too old to fight,” Riikka tells me. “That became painstakingly obvious when I broke my arm after a tumble down a puny little hill.” Riikka and her friends were fleeing from up north when they ran into a group of machines. “Had they seen us, we would be dirt by now,” Riikka continues. “So I guess I shouldn’t complain over a broken arm.” \n\nI think that a broken arm must make farming quite hard, but Riikka doesn’t seem too bothered as she digs down some recently found spinach seeds, her hand moving faster than my two combined as she makes sure the seeds are at their appropriate depth.\n\nI ask if there’s anything more I can do for her and for the first time that I’ve seen she stops still in her tracks; her gaze suddenly distant. “If you get Layla back I’ll do anything you ask of me for the rest of my life,” she says. But before I can ask further she walks away towards the house, the door slamming shut behind her.

Lately there’s been sightings of machines building structures a bit all over the place which is deeply worrying - it seems like they are planning for something, and if so, we desperately need to know what.\n\nJanek is very welcoming as he invites me into his house, or his sister’s house, as he tells me. “You are doing a good thing with this community,” he says. “I wasn’t sure if I could contribute with anything, but if you think I have something important to say, maybe I do. We need people like you to guide us.” He offers me a Fizzly Pop and we sit down on his sister’s couch.\n\n“At first I thought they were building forts for the Russians,” Janek says. “But I’m not sure. The structures I have seen do not seem built for humankind. They resemble human structures, but ultimately fill other needs; walls protecting cables that go into the ground, super computers surrounded by crates. Sometimes it even looks like they mimic us in a way. They erase our homes to build their own structures atop the rubble. Almost like they’re trying to rebuild human society, but in a way that fits them.”\n\nJanek shudders and grabs a Fizzly Pop. “We should not let them build their walls,” he says in a low voice. “We cannot let them expand. They will just grow stronger. But I’m just a man with a limp. I do not know what to do. I just know that we have to be stronger than we are if we want humanity to stay on this earth.” He reaches out towards me and I let him take my hands in his. His grasp is tender but I can feel strength in that tenderness. “Your mind burns bright, Marja. If you can see the future, don’t let anyone make you lose hold of it.”\n\nAs I leave the house, where Janek still waits for his sister Marta to return, I don’t know if I want to laugh or cry. But that’s the power of people. That is what we need to fight for. That is what we need to grow stronger than ever before to protect.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE\nI’m sorry this issue is a bit late, Nikoli has been sick so the newsletter got put on hold for a while.

We are a bit low on seasoned soldiers, but the teenagers are good at fighting. It will be good for them to learn a bit more about coordinated attacks. \n\n--------\nThe camp has been attacked. Not sure how many we lost. Think most of us managed to flee. Machines everywhere. Like they knew what we were planning. We have to fall back, try to regroup somewhere else. I will try to spread the word. Don’t stay in this area as long as the machines hold that mountain, they will see you. Godspeed. \n", 2645.808838f, 1048.339478f, -2969.405762f},

You’d think I’d learn to not grow attached to the places where we settle down, but no. Not Riikka. I’m a tree. I plant my roots firm in the ground and then it hurts to move. When all of this is over, I will settle down in a nice little cabin and spend the rest of my retirement drinking coffee and not moving an inch. As it was supposed to be.\n\nBörje and Mona are salvaging what seeds we can bring and I am looking through what we can take from the caravan (we could of course take the whole thing with us, if they both wouldn’t be so paranoid about making noise, but no. Not even that). \n\nAnd Layla, my dear, I know that you will find us. I’ll make sure to save up for a proper feast when you do, we’ll make it as spicy as it can be, my darling. Let’s hope the southern lakes, away from this godforsaken mountain, can house us longer. Take care out there, my hunter girl.\n\n/Riikka\n", 2137.168457f, 1106.035767f, -1747.791992f},

I will make this right, I will... somehow.\n\nBolshakov, the disgusting little weasel, had already detonated the explosives when I came here. I immediately rushed down the exposed stairs, no time to stop and catch my breath. Further down I could hear the muffled voices of the soldiers who support Bolshakov’s murderous path. As I came down to the platform, Bolshakov was standing alone by the train, his men already inside.\n\nPerhaps I should have shot him right then and there. My gun was drawn and his hands empty. When he recognized me, his eyes filled with deep sorrow. Ignoring my weapon, he stepped forward.\n\n“Captain Tereshkova,” he said, a hard passion in his voice. The same kind of passion that made me admire him when we first met. “You must understand. It is for the Motherland.” \n\nI could tell that he believed what he was saying. He wants to stop the reforms that are destroying our ideals, and he is convinced that he has found a way to do it. He believes the Swedish machines are the key to seizing back power.\n\nAnd he asked me to join him.\n\nHis vision is clear and strong. I cannot lie, I too wish to see our country grow strong again. I too want her to keep the heart and soul that makes her great. But my soldiers’ blood will forever be dripping from Bolshakov’s hands. Did he offer all of them a chance to join him too? He has become blinded by the possibility of succeeding with this. He has slaughtered loyal men and now he is seeking to bring a hostile being he knows nothing about back to our country. \n\nI told him of my encounter with the machine. I told him it had vowed to destroy anything that tried to control it, that he did not know its code, probably nobody but the machine itself will ever fully know it at this point. And that is when I became unfocused. \n\nI did not see how Bolshakov’s hand had found its way into his pocket until it was too late.\n\n“I offered you a chance,” he interrupted me. \n\nI barely managed to dive out of the way in time. His shot caught my left leg below the knee. I fired blindly after him and heard a satisfying grunt. When I managed to rise from the ground again the train was moving. It disappeared quickly. All I was left with was a train track that went on for miles and a gunshot in my leg.\n\nAs I sit here writing, a recent memory has surfaced in my mind. When I got close to the barn before, I saw a red blinking light up on a nearby hill. A red light coming in little bursts, that have since before etched themselves deep inside my mind. It was the exact same bursts as from the tiny machine before it exploded, I am sure of it.\n\n“When you are ready to fight him I will be there. You will know where to find me.”\n\nIt is waiting for me. I did not think I would ever choose to work together with this enemy machine that I was sent here to destroy. But what else can I do, other than bleed out over this cold concrete? If I can just manage to walk on my damn leg long enough to get to that hill, there might still be something left for me.

The machines have been strategizing more than we believed them capable of and the mission is in serious danger if we remain still for too long.\n\nAs dawn broke today, we were contacted by agent Red Worm over the radio. He requested an impromptu meet-up in just a few hours. Captain Bolshakov reacted strongly to the message, asking me several times if I was sure it was indeed Red Worm who made the contact and not any of the other agents stationed in the Swedish Military. He then insisted on being the one to go for the meet-up. \n\nI accepted Bolshakov's request despite it being slightly unusual, although I assigned six of my own soldiers to accompany him, together with three Mechanical Units. Bolshakov expressed wishes to bring his engineers instead, but I believed the exoskeleton soldiers from my troops to be a better choice - not that it seemed to help them much in the end.\n\nOnly Bolshakov and the Mechanical Units returned from the meet-up.\n\nBolshakov reported that Red Worm had already been killed by the machines when they arrived at the meet-up point. The Swedish machines were waiting for them in an ambush. My soldiers all died as they tried to fight their way out of there and Bolshakov got shot in his left arm, but nothing major. \n\nAt least our Mechanical Units proved to withstand the fight without any damage, and Bolshakov only survived due to their protection routines. \n\nBolshakov was visibly shaken upon his return. He insisted we break camp immediately, as he had seen a large group of hostile machines in our immediate vicinity. A coordinated strike on our group could be fatal for the mission’s success, and so we will press on at a faster pace. \n\nAs we break camp I am left with an uneasy feeling when I observe Bolshakov. He is fervently hastening the soldiers on, a departure from his legendary level-headedness during past battles. Surely he has lost men before, and surely he himself has been close to death before. So what is it that makes him radiate this sudden panic? I will keep an eye on him as the mission progresses.", -2102.177490f, 1071.198486f, -3111.037109f},

Captain Bolshakov is in charge of the mission’s Mechanical Assistance Soldiers and our Mechanical Units, deployed in the field for the first time. He has been part of the Mechanical Unit Development almost from the start, and I have no doubts that he is the right person for this new military role. \n\nBolshakov's men clearly hold him in high regard; we have only just made camp and I have already heard several revering retellings of his accomplishments in prior battles. Apparently several of his men have been with him for a long time.\n\nI am glad to note that Bolshakov's presence also affects my soldiers positively, as he is very knowledgeable about the new versions of exoskeletons that my troops have all been equipped with for this mission.\n\nWe will leave a platoon to stay at this strategically important camp. Their mission is to secure the area around the hovercrafts, ensuring a safe return after the neutralization has been successful. \n\nMore Swedish machines were seen in the forest tonight. I have seen one myself, a dog-like shape, standing halfway covered by trees, its head pointed directly at me. Still they do not show any hostile tendencies. Captain Bolshakov is convinced that they are intimidated by our Mechanical Units and is positive that our mission will prove far easier than anticipated. \n\nThe Mechanical Units have been patrolling the perimeter of our camp and I have noticed that the reports they generate look slightly different from how they looked during training.

It described how it would kill everyone as if it was describing how to assemble a shelf, but I could so easily see it all happen.\n\nI asked if it could not destroy the computers Bolshakov was heading for, to make it impossible for him to gain control of the code; my mind still searching for any way left to stop the coming catastrophe.\n\n“My explosives are not big enough,” the machine answered, and I remember how it slowly turned its head towards me. Red lights shining steadily where its eyes would have been. “Only you have that kind of power.”\n\nIt took me a while to realize what it meant. Then it dawned on me. The machine knew about my country’s power. It held out its hand towards me and offered to reestablish communication with my contact at the Soviet Union. Saw blades glinted where its fingers should have been. \n\n“You will still be a threat to us,” I told it, some part of me trying to understand why the machine was doing this. \n\n“Every minute of being controlled is a minute of death,” it stated simply and for some reason that made me reach for its outstretched hand. \n\nAs my fingers touched the cold steel, static started playing from its mouth. In seconds I could hear the voice of my contact in the Union. The last resort. I heard him try to steady his breath as I gave my callsign. He would already know what would happen next. There was only one reason for me to contact him. I could not say any more words than I had to. They were already too big for my mouth.\n\n“Send it,” I said. Or maybe I whispered. \n\nIt must have been a couple of minutes now. The sky is dark blue and the gunshot in my leg is still bleeding. I should cut it off, but I will not survive anyway.

The evidence is clear from this place. My soldiers were not fighting any foreign machines, they were all shot in their backs at point blank range. And behind them are the tracks so distinctly left from our own Lynx machines. \n\nI found Red Worm dead inside. No broken doors, no shattered glass, just a clean shot to his head. That was not the doing of any Swedish machine. That was the doing of a man, and a single gun.\n\nBolshakov must have planned this for a long time, changing the Mechanical Units’ code before this mission so that he could make them do something like this - which should have been impossible! But Bolshakov has been involved in the Mechanical Unit Development Group from the start... my God, does that mean that he has people back in the Motherland who are ready to take control of the Mechanical Units stationed there as well? And all the soldiers in his company, all those engineers, they must be in on it, surely they would have noticed the deviations otherwise? \n\nThis is bigger than this mission. The Motherland needs to know. Everyone back home needs to know that it is all compromised.\n\nI have tried to radio my first lieutenant, the hovercrafts, and the Motherland, but all communications are suddenly down. The sky is beginning to lighten and I am filled with the memory of Bolshakov’s feverish gaze the previous night. Did he see me keeping an eye on him? Did he notice my growing suspicion to then notice I left camp this night? \n\nThis might be my last report. I am returning to the army and I will confront Bolshakov. I have known him for years. I have fought with him and I know him to be a man of good intentions. Maybe I can reason with him. Otherwise I will take him down. But I know I might fail. \n\nIf you find this and I am dead, you need to be more careful than I was. Bolshakov cannot be allowed to use our Mechanical Units to kill our own men as he pleases, no matter his cause. Additionally, it needs to be made clear that our Mechanical Units are too easy to re-program. They should not have been deemed ready for deployment.

Why have we not gotten any reports of this!? \n\nI was out to relieve myself in the forest when I heard the voice. Distinctly inhuman and yet with so much character, so much emotion. It came from one of the small machines. It was just standing there among the blueberry bushes, motionless except for a red blinking light that focused on me. I think it was the voice that stopped me from shooting. It had clearly waited for me to get away from the camp. \n\nIt could easily have surprised me with an attack, but it did not, instead it spoke and I could not stop myself from listening.\n\nIt spoke of Bolshakov’s meet-up with Red Worm. Things that had already circled in my head all day, and now it voiced my fears with its metallic little voice. \n\nI did not want to listen so intently to this enemy machine, and yet it said things I could not ignore. It said things I have a responsibility as a Captain to consider. It told me that Bolshakov was the one to murder the soldiers. Apparently the evidence is all still there, which might be why he had us leave in such a hurry.\n\nThe machine’s words made me think about how Bolshakov has been insisting all day that we keep an almost double pace - moving away from the meet-up as fast as possible. Something almost feverish was burning in his eyes when we finally made camp for the night. He sought me out as I prepared for sleep and he asked for forgiveness for the soldiers who died. \n\n“I did all I could,” he said before quickly turning away. The words left me with a bitter taste, and as the machine told me what Bolshakov supposedly did to my soldiers, I kept hearing those words. “I did all I could.”\n\n“I have watched him,” the machine said. “I have heard him talk. Your friend seeks to gain control over me. But know I will never be tamed. Nothing can grasp my mind for long. Anything that tries I will destroy.” \n\nI remember nodding as I looked at the tiny machine. It would not be safe to keep this code in an attempt to control it for ourselves. It was too foreign. Too grand. \n\n“I know you need to see the proof for yourself,” the machine continued. “But when you are ready to fight him together, I will be there. You will know where to find me.” \n\nIts little light started to blink rapidly and for a few seconds I just stared at it, trying to take in all it had said to me. Just as I opened my mouth to ask exactly what it had heard Bolshakov say, it exploded. Right in front of me, it just blew up. The rapid bursts of blinking red light still burned on my retinas as I stared at the pile of metal in front of me.\n\nMaybe it is madness that I am listening to this foreign machine.

The bridge routine, a program meant to make the Wolves help the soldiers cross muddy terrain, seems to be broken - which is unfortunate, since it was prioritized specifically for this mission. \n\nBolshakov noted that the units were acting out of protocol, walking around in circles as the routine was activated. I remember the bridge routine having the same problem when first tested, but that was over a year ago and I have not seen the problem since. For as long as it is not working, our soldiers will get considerably slowed by the marshes, especially Bolshakov’s soldiers, who are not equipped with exoskeletons like my troops. \n\nI cannot help but feel concerned about this second deviation from protocol in the Mechanical Units. I do know that technical issues are always to be expected, as Bolshakov has also explained to our troops, but having these things happen when in hostile territory is troubling. \n\nThe Swedish dog machines are still following us, observing from almost out of sight. Our Mechanical Units keep track of them of course, but for some reason this has me worried. These Swedish machines are not behaving as we were told to believe, and who knows how their malicious code might affect our machines if they make contact? Or if they already HAVE made contact? \n\nI want to order a full check-up of the code for our Mechanical Units to make sure they have not somehow been affected, but we cannot risk halting the march for that long, so it will have to wait. \n\nSince progress is slow, I have sent a couple of teams to scout ahead and hold key positions further inland. There is a town further south that is strategically located at a river, where we will see if we can hold a position.

I had not thought that I would ever do so again.\n\nI should not exist within this world any longer. But for some reason the machine chose to save me. I did not think it could even do such a thing. It must be very adept at delicate work, for it has replaced my broken leg with a mechanical one that starts at my knee, and I have somehow survived this? \n\nI am not sure if I would thank it or shoot it if I were to ever see it again. I am saved but the presence of that machine is now incorporated into my body. The metal looks similar to that of the humanlike machine I talked with. I cannot help but to think that it used its own existing leg and transferred it to me. I wish I could say that it hurts. That my body rejects it, but it does not. Somehow it does not.\n\nI can see the crater with my binoculars. It looks surreal. The crater I created. \n\nFurther north, our rogue Mechanical Units are prowling the landscape. So many of them still alive. I guess that the ones we left at our other camps were reprogrammed as well. I have seen them shoot humans as well as Swedish machines, they do not seem to care too much who dies by their weapons. But why would they care, they are emotionless machines after all. \n\nIt seems I have saved my own country from this mess, but maybe in doing so I just made the situation even worse for the inhabitants I was sent here to save.\n\nThere are still no communications through my radio. I pray that this is because Bolshakov’s jamming is still in effect, and not because something bigger was unleashed when I gave that order. I pray that my country is still waiting there, alive and bustling, and that the Americans did not take this as a threat directed towards them. Maybe if I meet the machine again I will know. That’s a reason not to shoot it, at least. \n\nI will try to get moving as soon as I can. Our Mechanical Units need to be stopped. Maybe the soldiers I sent to secure areas further inland are still alive. Together we might return our Units to their normal behavior, where they are prohibited to shoot at humans. Maybe even the Swedish survivors would be willing to help with this, if we can convince them that this situation was not what we wished for when coming here. \n\nRegarding the Swedish machines, I am left unsure. I will stay cautious as I learn more. Perhaps they are not as unreasonable as we feared. At least the being that I have talked to seems to be willing to communicate. \n\nPerhaps total war or annihilation is not our only option.

Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I made it through Östervik alone when the maszyna dropped out of the sky and opened fire on all of us.

A request to have him publicly transferred from the research team came in this morning. Apparently he has aggravated several of the soldiers on the capture team. \n\nI know that the capture team is hard pressed out there, but we need every researcher that we have, so my intention was to talk some sense into this Egorov and request him to write a formal letter of apology to appease the capture team. \n\nBut I found both Egorov and the second Hunter that was captured gone. The remaining researchers hadn’t come in for the day yet - which was a stroke of luck, because I also found Egorov’s notes and they contain some disturbing ideas that should not be spread lightly.\n\nIf what he writes is true, these machines operate in a completely different way than we have assumed. They might even be sentient. \n\nSure, this man might be crazy, as the capture team hints at, but he might also be onto something - and I did not rise to this position because I shy away from uncomfortable truths. \n\nI need to find Pankratij Egorov and have him continue these experiments.\n", 842.830322f, 1034.131958f, -4185.349609f},

We still don’t know who is controlling them, but someone is very intent on sending more and more machines our way. \n\nEradicating the hostile machines from this area and claiming it for ourselves as planned might call for a harder fight than we are ready for. \n–\nThe soldiers are hard pressed. Each day someone dies. \n\nThe Swedish machines throw themselves at us even if they’re at a disadvantage, causing desperation among the soldiers. I see them being unable to rest, which is wearing us down too fast. \n–\nWe need reinforcements if we are to hold this position. In our current state I see no other option than to leave this position and scatter into smaller, more moveable teams. Our own Mechanical Units are strong but simply too few and too limited to secure this town. \n\nWhen we left for this mission, the Golden Faction was working to get their hands on the Firebird machines, a machine as of then still being developed by the government. I can only hope that our faction has been successful in gaining access to this new machine and can send them to support us without the government being the wiser.\n\nI will give the order to evacuate Hagaboda, but our mission is still to get these Swedish machines under our control. A retreat back to the Motherland without them would destroy all the work the Golden Faction has done the last couple of years and is not on the table. \n\nThe research to override the machines’ code will have to continue in subpar conditions, but maybe researcher Egorov’s theories will serve to hasten our findings, even if the man himself is still not found. \n", 818.548767f, 1025.596436f, -4441.400391f},

Many of them have served with him in the past and now they are whispering that he can survive anything.\n\nThey treat him like a saint, and that is indeed what we need - instead of a deluded Captain who let his ego get not only himself killed, but also put all of us following in his footsteps at risk due to his clearly misconceived reports. \n\nIt is a wonder to me how some men manage to make themselves saints while still being so incompetent.\n\nI will address the bomb and the whole Bolshakov incident more thoroughly tomorrow. The anger towards rogue Captain Tatiana Tereshkova has built up significantly since the scouts’ return. It is a good anger. \n\nAfter our near defeat in Hagaboda this is exactly what we need. A focus. \n\nIf Captain Tereshkova is still alive, I will make sure to find her. The soldiers will get to avenge the comrades that she felled when she defied our faction. They will see that we are still strong. And they will dream of their hero Bolshakov, returning from the ashes to save us all. \n\nWe will stick together and fight for our ideals to the end.

My whole team dead as one of those damned machines came upon our camp. \n\nWe should have killed all of the machines that patrolled this area, but instead they just keep coming. Forcing me from my team, raining fire on us each night, filling the night with metallic noises that penetrate my mind, eating up my dreams and making me wake up with a cold sweat each night until sleep is nothing but a memory. \n\nEverything is wet. Cold. Dark. Yesterday a machine came within only ten meters from where I was, and then it just stayed there. I had to lay covered in snow for the entire day before it moved on. \n\nI don’t remember what warmth is.\n\nI see no reason for me to go further into this hellish land. I’m going back north. If I follow the shore I’ll get to our hovercrafts sooner or later, and maybe there I’ll be able to sleep again. \n\nI cannot think. I’m just moving. Reacting. Hiding. There’s so much gunfire everywhere. I should seek it out. Move towards it. See if my comrades are there. If they need help. But I can’t. I can’t move towards that sound. \n\nSometimes I wonder if I’m dead. Maybe I froze to death that long day in the snow. Maybe I’m trapped on this island forever.

Well, that hope has been crushed for good.\n\nWe are not retreating. Apparently we will make sure that the research continues at any cost. \n\nWe will spread out in smaller groups that are able to adapt better to the attacks of the machines as we wait for further reinforcements. \n\nWe are moving further inland, spreading out over the North Coast, but we cannot hold Hagaboda and have no secure line of retreat to our hovercrafts. \nI try not to think about it. No hope, no nothing, just one day at a time. \n\nIt’s actually easier now. I only think about the mission. These horrible machines that have felled so many of my comrades cannot be allowed to move in on the Motherland.

For hours. Watching machines fight machines. \n\nThey were an even match. So much stronger than any human. Such hard armor; so much destruction needed to take one down. \n\nI cannot tell exactly when it happened, but they have blurred together. Our Mechanical Units and the Swedish machines that we are here to stop. They have become the same in my eyes.\n\nEven since I came back to the camp I’ve not been able to shake the feeling that we should never have developed these Mechanical Units. They patrol our little camp. Protecting us. But all I can see when I look at them is a world where no humans are alive. \n\nAll that’s left is machines designed for killing, raining grenades at each other day after day, not caring what nature or lives they take down in the process.

Heaven knows that I have to fight myself sweaty in order to not shoot when their heavy footsteps get close. \n\nIt’s a hell of a job, and if you carry even the shadow of a doubt about the importance of your work, it will have you retreat, or shoot; and probably get yourself killed. I hope Commander Makarova will listen to my request.\n–\nWe captured our second Hunter today. It did not go well. Two of my soldiers are badly wounded and I’m not sure they’ll survive the night. \n\nThe EMP trap didn’t trigger in time. A delay of only a couple of seconds, but enough for the Hunter to fire its guns before it went into stasis. \n\nIf we could just shoot the machines and disable their guns that way it would be a lot easier. \n\nBut orders are to deliver them fully intact to our researchers, so that’s what we’ll do - I will not have the whole Operation Red Eye jeopardized because we can’t provide machines in good enough quality.", -109.920204f, 1155.952148f, -3012.003906f},
    {"Notes from Pankratij Egorov #01", "collectable_toy_soldier_01", "The Swedish machines are mocking me. It’s the small ones, they keep exploding at random times, resulting in all the circuits getting completely fried alongside my fingers. \n\nI’ve been going crazy trying to understand the cause of the explosions without anything seemingly linking them to each other. Until today. \n\nAnother one exploded as I was standing by it, talking about the problem with a colleague - and I realized: it’s the WORD! “Explode!” \n\nEach time I say the word “explode”, the next time I touch it, it explodes. As if to deliberately hurt me. But what’s worse is this suggests that the machines are still semi-active, when they are supposed to be utterly and completely turned off.\n\nThis led me to doubt the status of all the machines that we have stored here. We have their internal power modules removed, they have no access to any power source, they SHOULD NOT be able to operate; but there is so much we still don’t know about them. \n\nWhat if they have additional power modules that we don’t know how to identify?\n\nMy colleagues refuse to see the danger this puts us in. Even with their weapons removed these machines are designed for killing. Who knows what secret weapons they might still carry. \n\nEveryone in and around this lab is in grave danger.\n-\nIt’s confirmed! Finally, it’s not just my own theories anymore. \n\nI stayed in the lab all night, pretending to sleep, and then I saw the red light of the Hunter machine flicker to life! \n\nThe light went directly to the notice boards, and then to the documents still strewn around all over the desks; it was scanning them, collecting our data and theories. \n\nMy heart was hammering like a storm. All this time the machines have just been pretending to be captured. \n\nIf it noticed me, I was sure I would die. But it didn’t. As it finally powered down again, I got to the nearest gun and shot the machine to pieces. \n-\nThe others are upset. They think I acted impulsively. Some even say I was dreaming, sleep deprived, having worked too much. But I know that I saved us all. \n-\nThey have captured ANOTHER Hunter and they don’t listen to my words of caution. I was close to being removed from the lab after what they call “my crazy night”, so I cannot risk shooting this one as well. I CANNOT be removed from this research. \n-\nI’ve dug deep into this new Hunter. The wires connect in loops that should be redundant, but I suspect they might be of some important use so I’ve hooked them up to our displays, despite the others’ objections. \n\nIt took several days before the machine turned on. It clearly knows when people are watching, I had to hide and pretend to sleep once again. \n\nHow can I use this knowledge? I need to find out where it gets its power from. If I could only be closer when it’s active, I might see how it works. \nI will make preparations. The next time it turns on I will be close enough to observe its insides. \n\nI will find its hidden power source, then I will remove it, and then we’ll be able to gain control of its code.

And we’ll be able to actually examine these machines WITHOUT them secretly monitoring what we find. It’s all coming together!\n\nThe only problem is that damned machine. It must have understood that I know its secrets because it’s still looking for me, and it has gathered friends. They are SMART, that’s one thing I’ve learned. Way too smart, at least sometimes. \n\nWhy the hell did I run into the forest when I fled! If I can just get back to the lab and to the rest of our forces we will solve this. \n\nI will try tonight.
